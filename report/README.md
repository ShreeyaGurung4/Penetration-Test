Penetration Testing Project (University Coursework)

This folder contains my full penetration testing project for the BS3944 module at university. The report includes:

- 🖥️ Virtual lab setup (Kali, Linux VMs)
- 🔍 Reconnaissance with Dmitry & Nmap
- 🕳️ Vulnerability scanning (Nikto, OpenVAS, Burp Suite)
- 🔐 Password analysis (Hydra, CeWL, John the Ripper)
- 💥 Exploitation using Metasploit
- 📊 Risk matrix and mitigation strategies
- 📸 Annotated screenshots and command outputs

This repository contains two key documents: BS3944.Pentesting Practical 1.pdf, which illustrates the practical phase of the penetration test with embedded screenshots and command evidence, and BS3944.Written Report.pdf, a formal written report that discusses risk analysis, threat models, and mitigation strategies.
